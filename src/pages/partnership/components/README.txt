# MtFujiEscape.jsx

This is the FULL JSX version converted from your original `MtFujiEscape.tsx`.

### Changes made
- Removed TypeScript generics on hooks like `useState<Type>()`
- Removed type annotations in function parameters `(e: React.FormEvent)` â†’ `(e)`
- Removed variable type annotations `: string`, `: number`, etc.
- Structure and line count preserved (should remain ~1.1k lines).

Now you can drop this file directly into your React project.
